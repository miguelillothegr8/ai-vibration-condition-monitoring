In the document data_dict a dictionary with tensors is saved
In the dictionary there are two keys "data" and "label"
The "data" key gives back a torch.tensor of n amount of images with are 2D tensors (for now 224x224 with values between 0-255)
The "label" key gives back a torch.tensor of the same n amount of labels
    1 means the data was Healthy
    0 means the data was Damaged

To pull the data again
    import torch

    data_dict = torch.load("data_dict.pt")

# ai-vibration-condition-monitoring
D04 AI Vibration-based condition monitoring setup

This project is an algorithm that is able to perform vibration-based
condition monitoring on wind turbine gearboxes to indicate their state. 
This will be done through machine learning with a Convolutional Neural Network. 
Inputs for this CNN will be images, which are generated from data from sensors on the gearbox.

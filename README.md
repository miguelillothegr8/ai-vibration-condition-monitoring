This program is the result of an project done by Aerospace Engineering students from TUDelft. The purpose is  to design a Convolutional Neural Network that can efficiently
and accurately distinguish healthy from damaged wind turbine gearboxes. Two convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) were constructed for this purpose: one using images with time-
domain signals directly and one using preprocessed spectrograms. These models were trained
using data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and iterated upon with
different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize the performance for potential usage
in real-time. An accuracy of 99.82% and 100% was achieved for the two models respectively with
faster computational times compared to previous models. Additionally, data augmentation
was performed to further analyze the capabilities of each model.
